# Predicting IoT Network Vulnerabilities: A Data-Driven Approach to Ensuring Security in an Expanding Digital Landscape

### Overview
This project focuses on predicting potential vulnerabilities in IoT (Internet of Things) networks by leveraging machine learning techniques. Given the rapid expansion of IoT devices, ensuring their security has become paramount. This project explores the use of data-driven methods to enhance the security posture of IoT systems by identifying and mitigating risks before they can be exploited.

### Problem Statement
IoT devices are increasingly becoming targets of cyberattacks due to their widespread deployment and often limited security measures. This project aims to develop a predictive model that identifies vulnerabilities in IoT networks using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing network traffic data and identifying patterns, the model can predict potential security threats.

### Goals
- To analyze IoT network traffic data and detect abnormal patterns.
- To apply machine learning algorithms to predict potential vulnerabilities.
- To propose a solution for mitigating risks in IoT networks before they can be exploited.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains network traffic data collected from IoT devices. It includes both normal and abnormal behaviors, helping to differentiate between benign activities and potential attacks.

- **Features include**:
  - Packet size
  - Connection duration
  - Protocol used
  - Source and destination IP addresses
  - Anomalous activity flags
  - And other relevant network traffic metadata

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and processed the raw network traffic data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features to enhance predictive accuracy.
3. **Model Selection**: Applied machine learning models such as:
   - Logistic Regression

   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
4. **Model Tuning**: Performed hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
5. **Evaluation**: The model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure its effectiveness in predicting vulnerabilities.

### Results
- The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy in predicting IoT vulnerabilities, with an accuracy of 89.5%.
- The model was able to effectively distinguish between normal and malicious network activities.
  
### Key Findings
- IoT devices, particularly those with minimal security configurations, are vulnerable to attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS), unauthorized access, and malware injection.
- By analyzing network traffic patterns, we can predict potential vulnerabilities and prevent them before they cause harm.

### Technologies Used
